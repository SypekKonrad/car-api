## Technology Stack
* Django 
* Django Rest Framework
* SQLite

Django is a high-level web framework that comes with a wide range of built-in features such as authentication, admin interface, ORM, and a powerful routing system. This makes development faster as you don't need to reinvent the wheel for common web development tasks.

DRF is a flexible and powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. It provides serializers for data serialization/deserialization, class-based views, authentication, pagination, and more, which simplifies API development.

SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, and self-contained database engine that requires minimal setup and administration. It's ideal for small to medium-sized projects or prototypes where simplicity and ease of use are priorities.
